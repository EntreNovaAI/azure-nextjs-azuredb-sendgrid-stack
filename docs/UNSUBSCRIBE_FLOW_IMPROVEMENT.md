## Technical Implementation

### Key Code Changes

#### 1. Downgrade Detection and Offer
```typescript
if (user.accessLevel === 'premium') {
  const downgradeOption = window.confirm(
    'üí° Would you like to downgrade to our Basic plan...'
  )
  
  if (downgradeOption) {
    router.push('/dashboard#upgrade-section')
    setUnsubscribeStatus('Redirecting you to downgrade options...')
    return
  }
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Confirmation
```typescript
const planName = user.accessLevel === 'premium' ? 'Premium' : 'Basic'
const confirmed = window.confirm(
  `‚ö†Ô∏è Are you sure you want to cancel your ${planName} subscription?\n\n` +
  'Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period...'
)
```

#### 3. Better Success Messaging
```typescript
if (result.success) {
  const endDate = result.data?.note || 'the end of your current billing period'
  setUnsubscribeStatus(
    `‚úì Subscription canceled successfully!\n\n` +
    `Your ${planName} plan will remain active until ${endDate}. ` +
    `After that, you'll be moved to the Free plan. You can resubscribe anytime from the dashboard.`
  )
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.reload()
  }, 3000)
}
```

#### 4. Status Message Styling
```tsx
{unsubscribeStatus && (
  <div className={`mt-4 p-4 rounded text-sm whitespace-pre-line ${
    unsubscribeStatus.includes('‚úì') || unsubscribeStatus.includes('Redirect') 
      ? 'bg-green-500/10 text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 border border-green-500/20' 
      : 'bg-destructive/10 text-destructive border border-destructive/20'
  }`}>
    {unsubscribeStatus}
  </div>
)}
```
